# Honeypot Deployed: Ubuntu - Dionaea over HTTP
### GCP was Used to Complete this Assignment

## Issues
The only issue encounterd was during installation. I had problems cloning the git repo onto the VM using the instructions found in the
tutorial. After doing some digging, I found a different repo, and a different installation file to use and everything worked fine.

## Summary of Attacks
After only deploying the honeypot for roughly 30 minutes, I have already recieved over 100 attacks from all over the world. The most commonly attacked port is port 8088. At this time there have been no maleware samples.

## Questions
I am very surprised at how many attacks I have recieved in such a short time. I am curious as to how these attacks are being performed and how these attackers have found me so quickly.
